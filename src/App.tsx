It seems there was a misunderstanding in your request. You've provided the word "None" instead of an actual code snippet that needs to be converted into a top-level React app component. Without a specific code example, I'm unable to generate a React component for you.

If you have a specific piece of code, especially one involving AngularJS that you'd like to convert to React, please provide that code snippet, and I'll be happy to assist with the conversion. Remember to include any specific requirements or details you'd like incorporated into the React component.
